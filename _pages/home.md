    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p>I am a Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/ucl-department-economics" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">University College London</a>. My current research uses unstructured data to build new
        measures of economic activity and behavior across a variety of applications, most often related to organizational
        economics and monetary policy. I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/sekhansen" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Github page</a> where I share code and lecture slides related to methodologies for the
        analysis of unstructured and high-dimensional data. I co-organize the monthly <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/view/amleds/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMLEDS</a> webinar
        that explores economic applications of machine learning. My research is supported by an ERC Conslidator Grant.</p>
